#I am a foodie so I created a page where one can know the famous foods in different states of India.
#I made the page for 5 states namely Andhra Pradesh(my native),TamilNadu,MadhyaPradesh,Gujarath,Assam.
#I created five divisions for each state with a link to visit the wikipedia website on clicking the State name.
#I also made this page viewport by adding the meta tag related to it in the head section.
#I applied css to the html page in a different file with separate classes attached to it.
#I also used a logo and a header for the two headings on the top of the page.
#I linked the css file in the head section.
#My files can be viewed by using the following link of github:
